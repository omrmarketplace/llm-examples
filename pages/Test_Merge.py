If it was April 2024, you could say \"free until nearly 2026\"\n\nA value proposition of 0% APR credit card could also be:\nNo interest, Pause your credit card interest, or halt interest\n\nWhen there is an offer in the advertisement that could be localized, use the dynamic replacement ${region:capitalized}$ in the refreshed creatives, where relevant. Credit card offers would not be a local offer. But home insurance would be a local offer.\n\nIn Native advertising it is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT that you probe curiosity in the user. Here are some ways to do this that you can incorporate into your refreshes:\n1. Use language that hints at a unique truth such as: the real truth, what something actually costs, why something suddenly is so cheap, etc. - with the key words of addition there being \"real\", \"actually\", and \"suddenly\"\n\n2. Use english slang for superlative synonyms such as: hands down, absolutely, must-have, can't-miss, slam dunk, no brainer, etc.\n\n"
